	for beta 2.1.1d.
	* src/search.c: Wrong revision was pulled out
	for beta 2.1.1d.

	* src/grep.c: ck_atoi () added instead of atoi ().
	Suggestion from Jim Meyering.
	ck_atoi () pulled from diffutils-2.7, maintained by Paul Eggert.

	* AUTHORS: Rephrase of some sentences.
	* README:  Rewording.
	Noted and patched by Joel N. Weber II.

1998-04-17 Kaveh R. Ghazi

	* src/dfa.h: Don't define `const', trust autoconf to handle it.

1998-04-16 Alain Magloire

	* tests/{status,empty}.sh: wrong return status.

	* src/grep.c: Remove the REGEX part in usage (), it was
	consider overkill by most.

1998-04-14  Eli Zaretskii

	* djgpp/config.bat: Support file names with multiple dots on all
	platforms.

	* djgpp/README: Add instructions about file names illegal on
	MS-DOS.

1998-04-13 Alain Magloire

	* src/dfa.c: by "popular" demand reverse
	back to '_' not word-constituent.

	* grep-1.1.1c available for testing.

1998-04-13  Karl Heuer

	* src/grep.c: (a) The directory check is done too early:
	logically, if the argument is "-", then it refers to standard
	input, regardless of whether there's something in the file
	system answering to "-".
	(b) The sh command "grep -l root /etc/passwd /etc/group 0<&-"
	prints "(standard input)" instead of "/etc/passwd", because it
	mistakenly believes that a named file will never be opened on fd
	0.  The string "(standard input)" should be based on the file
	having been originally specified as "-", rather than making
	assumptions about the fd.
	(c) the code that calls close(fd) is being done outside of the
	test for a bad fd.  Thus, if the open failed, this code will
	attempt to close(-1).  It should be done inside the "fd != -1"
	branch.
	This patch addresses all three of these problems.

1998-04-13 Alain Magloire

	* configure.in: remove the deprecated AC_ISC_POSIX macro.
	Spotted by Karl Heuer.

1998-04-03  Eli Zaretskii

	* djgpp/main.mak, djgpp/src.mak, djgpp/tests.mak: Updated from the
	relevant Makefile.in files.

	configure script does.

1998-03-28  Eli Zaretskii

	* djgpp/main.mak, djgpp/src.mak, djgpp/tests.mak: Updated to track
	changes in respective Makefile.in files.

	* src/dosbuf.c (guess_type): Avoid running off the end of the
	buffer.  Spotted by Paul Eggert.

1998-03-27  Alain Magloire

	* grep-2.1.1b.tar.gz available.

	* src/regex.c: CLASS_CHAR_MAX set to 256 instead of 6
	when WCTYPE and WCHAR are not defined. When class names
	where bigger then 6, it will not detect an error.
	example '[[:alphabet:]]'.

	* Updated the copyright of the files with emacs.
	With emacs Jim :).

1998-03-26 Jim Meyering

	* src/dfa.c (IS_WORD_CONSTITUENT): Define.
	(lex): Use IS_WORD_CONSTITUENT, not ISALNUM.
	Don't special-case '_'.
	(dfastate): Use IS_WORD_CONSTITUENT, not ISALNUM.
	(dfaexec): Likewise.

1998-03-25  Alain Magloire

	* tests/warning.sh: typos and replace the echos with
	a simple cat.
	Noted By Jim Meyering.

	* src/regex.c: #undef ISASCII and ISPRINT before defining
	them(On Solaris it was define).
	Pattern 'a[[:]:]]b' is an invalid char class and the error
	from regex was 1(REG_NOMATCH) instead of 2 (REG_ECTYPE).
	Fix with help from Ulrich Drepper.

	* src/grep.c (usage): Ulrich wrote: "A single printf should
	not have more than 900 bytes. For translation reasons the
	text shouldn't be split in too many pieces since this is
	tiresome and also does not help to generate a consistent picture."
	Noted by Ulrich Drepper.
	* src/grep.c (usage): Dig out and old patch from
	Franc,ois to explain the regex in usage().
	Ideas from Franc,ois Pinard.

1998-03-23 Alain Magloire

	* testing: grep-2.1.1a for testing.

	* configure.in: Solaris needs '-lw' if we use wchar/wctype
	functions.
	* src/btowc.c: New file from GNU libc. Solaris 2.5 don't
	have it define.
	* configure.in : check for btowc ().

	* regex.c: Include <wchar.h> before <wctype.h>, to work around
	a Solaris 2.5 bug.
	Patch provided by Paul Eggert.

	* tests/status.sh: new file to check return status code.
	* tests/empty.sh: new file to check for empty pattern.
	* tests/warning.sh: new file to tell where to report errors.

	* configure.in: If available, prefer support for large files
	unless the user specified one of the CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS, or LIBS
	variables.
	Done by Paul Eggert.

	* src/grep.c (usage): change prep.ai.mit.edu for gnu.org.

1998-03-18 Alain Magloire

	* src/grep.c (usage): Formating the --help message a bit off.
	Noted by William Bader.

	* src/grep.c (main): When checking conflicting matcher for option -E the
	matcher was to "egrep" instead of "posix-egrep".
	Reported by kwzh@gnu.org.

	* src/grep.c: Typos and rewording the --help message.
	Reported by Karl Heuer.

	* src/grep.1: The man page wording :
	  A regular expression matching a single character may be
	  followed by one of several repetition operators:
	is unclear since 'x(yz)*z' is a valid regex.
	Remove the "matching a single character".
	Suggested by Harald Hanche-Olsen.

	* src/grep.c (main): `-f /dev/null' now specifies no patterns
	and therfore matches nothing.
	Reported by Jorge Stolfi.
	Patched by Paul Eggert.

1998-03-10 Alain Magloire

	* Ice storm 98(el nino). Lost grep repository disk,
	and my $HOME directory, etc ..
	Trying to get the emails/patch from dejanews.com
	and start from grep-2.1.
	sigh ....

1997-11-01 Alain Magloire

	* src/grep.c: For the long options, the problems are:
	--file appears in the option table as 'no_argument'
	instead of 'required_argument'.
	--files-with-matches is missing from the option table.
	The help lists '--fixed-strings' as the long option for -F,
	the table has '--fixed-regexp'.
	--regexp appears in the option table as 'no_argument'
	instead of 'required_argument'.
	--with-filename is missing from the option table.
	Reported by Grant McDorman and Krishna Sethuraman.

1997-10-19 Alain Magloire

	* src/grep.c: the option "with-filename was not in the arg table.
	Corrected by Jim Hand.

	* GNU gettext library from gettext-0.10.32.

	* src/grep.c: reverse back to greping directories,
	One could skip the error message by defining
	SKIP_DIR_ERROR. There is no clear way of doing
	things, I hope to setle this on the next majore release
	Thanks Paul Eggert, Eli Zaretskii and gnits for the
	exchange.

	* tests/status.sh: add this check to make sure
	That the return status code is ok.

1997-10-10 Andreas Schwab

	* grep.c (long_options) [O_BINARY]: Add DOS-specific options.
	(fillbuf) [O_BINARY]: For DOS-style text files, strip CR
	characters at end of line.
	(prline) [O_BINARY]: Report correct byte offsets, even though CR
	characters were stripped when reading the file.
	(usage) [O_BINARY]: Add DOS-specific options.
	(setmatcher) [HAVE_SETRLIMIT]: Set re_max_failures so that the
	matcher won't ever overflow the stack.
	(main) [__MSDOS__, _WIN32]: Handle backslashes and drive letters
	in argv[0], remove the .exe suffix, and downcase the prgram name.
	[O_BINARY]: Pass additional DOS-specific options to getopt_long
	and handle them.  Call stat before attempting to open the file, in
	case it is a directory (DOS will fail the open call for
	directories).  Switch the input descriptor to binary mode, unless
	it is a terminal device.

	* system.h [O_BINARY]: Define macros to switch a handle to binary
	mode, so binary files could be grep'ed on MS-DOS and MS-Windows.
	[HAVE_SETLOCALE]: Test for HAVE_SETLOCALE instead of
	HAVE_LC_MESSAGES, to prevent compilation error in grep.c on
	systems which don't define HAVE_LC_MESSAGES, but have setlocale.

	* dosbuf.c: New file, functions specific for MS-DOS/MS-Windows.
	(guess_type, undossify_input, dossified_pos): New functions.

	* djgpp/config.h, djgpp/config.bat, djgpp/main.mak, djgpp/src.mak,

	Reported by Michael Aichlmay
	Corrected with guidance from Ulrich Drepper

1997-07-24 Alain Magloire <alainm@rcsm.ee.mcgill.ca>

	* Makefile.am: corrected an error when installing {f,e}grep.1.
	From Kaveh R. Ghazi <ghazi@caip.rutgers.edu>.
	From Ulrich Drepper <drepper@cygnus.com>.

	* Many files: use PARAMS instead of __STDC__ for prototypes.
	From Jim Meyering <meyering@eng.ascend.com>.
	Patch provided by Kaveh R. Ghazi <ghazi@caip.rutgers.edu>.

	* dfa.[ch]: uses the one in gawk-3.0.3 with the patch from
	Arnold (see Changelog: July 12 1997)

	* grep.1: a note to say -l, -L, -q stop on first match.
	Noted by Andrew Beattie <gaffer@tug.com>.

	* grep.c: refuse to scan if the file is a directory.
	This was causing problems on SUNs. If the directory contains
	a file that could match the pattern, garbage was display.

	* tests directory: added new set of tests from Henry Spencer
	regex package. Change the way the tests were done to be more
	conformant to automake.

	* configure.in: added --disable-regex for folks with their own fuctions.

1997-07-17 Alain Magloire <alainm@rcsm.ee.mcgill.ca>

	* src/grep.c: Cause grep to fail if `fclose (stdout)' fails.
	From Jim Meyering <meyering@eng.ascend.com>.

	* grep.c:usage() more consistency in the --help.

	* egrep, fgrep were links This is in violation of GNU standards:
	"Please don't make the behavior of a utility depend on the name used
	to invoke it.  It is useful sometimes to make a link to a utility with
	a different name, and that should not change what it does."
	For now egrep and fgrep will be copies of grep. A better scheme
	should be found later.
	After discussion with Tom Tromey <tromey@cygnus.com>.

	* fgrep.man and egrep.man included: They are stubs that call grep.1.
	* Makefile.am: modified to install {f,e,}grep[,.1].

	* speed hack for -l, -L: bail out on first match.
	From Scott Weikart <scott@igc.apc.org>.

	* *.[ch]: provided prototypes for strict argument checking
	With the help of Stewart Levin <stew@sep.stanford.edu>.

	* memchr.c: New file, from GNU libc.
	* grep.c (memchr): Remove definition.
	* configure.in: Use AC_REPLACE_FUNCS for memchr.

	* grep.c: HAVE_WORKING_MMAP -> HAVE_MMAP.

	* system.h: New file.
	* dfa.c, kwset.c, grep.c, search.c: Use it instead of duplicating
