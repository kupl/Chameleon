# This is a stub for the Unix Makefile, to provide support for doing
# "make install" in the top Vim directory.

# NOTE: If this doesn't work properly, first change directory to "src" and use
# the Makefile there:
#	cd src
#	make [arguments]
# Noticed on AIX systems when using this Makefile: Trying to run "cproto" or
# something else after Vim has been compiled.  Don't know why...
