This directory contains the actual sed input scripts for use in 
	the test suite.

Each scipt is named in this fashion: 

s[Num1]_[Num2].sed where Num1 is the test frame and Num2 is 
either the version number OR the sequence number (for test 
cases which use multiple script inputs). 

The smoke directory contains tests from the original
testsuite(s) that accompanied the different versions
of GNU sed.  Smoketests were obtained from sed-4.1.5 (v7)

* It should be noted that many of the scripts in this directory
* are modified versions of example scripts in the book
* sed & awk 2nd edition by Dale Dougherty and Arnold Robbins
* published by O'Reilly in 1997.
