This directory contains the actual inputs to the sed program:

default.in:	the common input file for sed to perform
		manipulations on

default2.in:	a second, simple input file for a single
		test frame

stdin.in	a file that flows through the -I[] mts
	        interface

binary.exe:	an executable file for an error test frame

biglines.in:	a file with lines too large for sed to 
		handle

inplace.in	a file identical in content to default.in
		but is used by v5+ sed for inplace edits

scr:		a directory containing the numbered *.sed
		files, each of which corresponds to a test
		frame in the v*_*.frame file

*.inp		input files for the various smoke tests 
		provided by the original authors of the
		sed unix utility

* It should be noted that many of the scripts in the scr directory
* are modified versions of example scripts in the book

* published by O'Reilly in 1997.
